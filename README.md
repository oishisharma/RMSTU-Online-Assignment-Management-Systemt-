The Assignment Management System (AMS) is designed to facilitate the online download and upload of assignments for students. Each assignment includes detailed information such as instructions, descriptions, deadlines, and submission specifics. The primary objective of this system is to enable the online submission of assignments and provide an interface for instructors to upload test programs, allowing for automatic evaluation of assignments.

This project eliminates the need for students to submit physical files, streamlining the submission process. The proposed system reduces human error and assists supervisors (teachers and faculty) in managing and controlling student submissions effectively. Additionally, it allows supervisors to share documents and files with their students.

One of the most significant advantages of online assignment submission is the faster transmission of assignments compared to traditional methods. This efficiency saves time and costs for teachers, enabling them to provide quicker responses and enhance the quality of feedback to students.
